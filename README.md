# My Personal Website

A monorepo for my next personal website. This is created for learning purposes and to replace my old, ugly personal website, which I hope no one is unfortunate enough to see.

## About this Repo (WIP)
* Uses Next.js as a frontend
* Uses Golang & Gin for the backend
* Deploys to AWS using Terraform
* Uses GitHub Actions & Terraform for CI/CD.
